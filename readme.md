# Overview

This document shows how to use Makerfabs products.

Answer frequently asked questions.

Provide fast - developing sample and pin library maintenance.

# How To Use?

Makerfabs has three  main product lines :
- ESP32-based "MakePython" serial.
- ESP32 serial.
- Arduino-based "Maduino" serial.

**It is used in different ways according to different serial products.** The use of the development board is described in detail in three folders :

- **/Arduino_Maduino** : Based on traditional Arduino board like Arduino Pro Mini or Arduino Zero.
- **/Arduino_ESP32** : Develop ESP32 with the Arduino IDE.
- **/MakePython** : Develop ESP32 with MakePython .

These folders explain how to do code burning for different modules, the simple configuration of the IDE. 

It also explains some development points caused by hardware inconsistencies, such as Pin-Settings.



# GPIO/PINS

Some modules have modified the default IO port due to wiring or onboard components. For example, I2C and SPI interfaces are different from standard Arduino and ESP32.

In file "/Makerfabs_FAQ/pins_define/makerfabs_pin.h" support pins define. Use a copy of the project file under the reference file. And uncomment the board you are using.

```c++
//BOARD

#define MP_ESP32 OK
//#define MP_ESP32_COLOR OK
//#define ESP32_TSC_9488 OK
//#define ESP32_ILI9341 ERR don't use

//SHIELD
#define MP_AUDIO OK
